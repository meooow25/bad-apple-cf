Play [Bad Apple!!](https://youtu.be/FtutLA63Cp8) on your [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) activity graph, because why not.

1. Get a userscript manager, like [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/), [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or others.
2. Install the script `bad_apple_cf.user.js`, by visiting its raw Github URL, which is [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meooow25/bad-apple-cf/main/bad_apple_cf.user.js).
3. Codeforces is now much more fun.
